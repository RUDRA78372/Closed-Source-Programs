#The Chromium Protector
The job of this program is to protect your chromium based browser using password.
Works well with chromium, opera gx, whatsapp. Please test for your own browsers too.

##How to use?
1.Locate your chromium based browser executable

2.Hit Patch!

3.Create a password and hit save.

It is recommended to save your backup file(Usually chrome.exe.bak) to some other location so that no one can restore that to unlock your browser without your permission. 

To remove the password protection, simply restore the backup using the program or rename the file yourself and remove the .bak extension.

###This program is provided with NO WARRANTY. If you mess up anything using the program, it's your headache.
